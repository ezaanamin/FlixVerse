# FlixVerse

## Description
FlixVerse is a full-stack streaming website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with Python for implementing a content-based filtering recommendation system. This platform aims to provide users with an immersive streaming experience, allowing them to browse and watch a wide range of movies while receiving personalized recommendations based on their viewing history and preferences.

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles.
2. **Movie Catalog:** A comprehensive catalog of movies is available for users to browse, search, and explore.
3. **Streaming:** Seamless streaming of movies with an intuitive player interface.
4. **Personalized Recommendations:** Utilizing a content-based filtering algorithm implemented in Python, FlixVerse suggests movies to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and movie attributes.
5. **User Interaction:** Users can rate movies, add them to watchlists, and provide feedback to improve the recommendation system.
6. **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB: For storing movie data and user information.
- Express.js: To handle HTTP requests and API routing.
- React.js: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface, leveraging Redux and Context API for state management.
- Node.js: As the backend runtime environment.
- Python: Implementing the content-based filtering recommendation system.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the backend server using `npm start` in the server directory.
4. Start the frontend development server using `npm start` in the client directory.
